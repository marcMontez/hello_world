Learning GitHub
/* My name is Marc. I currently work in healthcare (Nursing) but I've always loved and have wanted to learn how to program and build projects. It's a total fantasy right now but I would love to actually work on projects. I'm interested in coding specifically but it honestly doesn't matter what at this point, front end, back end, I'm open to anything. I just have a craving to learn as much as I can.
